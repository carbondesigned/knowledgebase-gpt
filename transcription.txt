fresh one point threes out yet we got a new release you better get used to it because we are planning to release new minor versions for fresh on a monthly basis from now on we promised in the last video that we are betting on fresh and we're taking to that promise this development cycle contained a lot of incredible pears from the community and we are thrill to see all the excitement around fresh the documentation has been expanded and improved many bugs were fixed and no features were added here are the main takeaway
it is from this release in past versions passing data from a router handler to the pages component require a bit of annoying boiler plate to ensure type safety you had to create an interface for the components props passed that to the handlers typogeneric and then use that in component definition the handler is very often highly coupled to the component it will render soviet up merging the together as a result starting with fresh one point three the previous code can be refractor to something like this don't worry
is no need to rewrite all your route the new approach is an additional option that can make simple routes bit easier to write it is not a requirement to use a sing routes and there will still be a lot of scenarios where you'll need the handler anyway however this go to show that here a dino we are committed to remove boilerplate and simplify the coding experience whenever possible in this new version we are also improving our errohandling support when something fails in route handler fresh will now automatically render the five hundred sexe
the does are fall back and in rarer situations when errors are thrown during rendering add in support for error boundaries when react detects components that have a component did catch method or a static get derived state from error method those components become error boundaries and can catch errors and render a full-back idon't worry we now that experience feels a bit row at a moment and we are already considering different ways to make this api feel more integrated with fresh itself and since we are talking
the experience we got new linting-rules better error messaging in the configuration process and various quality of life improvements such as being able to access route parameters from every handler and a better starter temple to help you start the project in no time in version one point two we make sure you can structure islands in folder subfolderin this new version we are adding even more flexibility to islands and ukenomicporters many islands in a file as you want grouping islands in a single file reduces the number of requests
o make and can even make some sites a little bit faster finally builds on top of dina one point thirty-five release and will use denoserve when possible this new apia is not just faster but also simpler than the previous alternative as always you can find the detailed overview of the latest fresh version individual description please click the subscribe baton if you an to stay up to date with everything denorelated and see you in the next one
